                    <p>One of the additional assignments available to High Ranking Staff is serving as a Training Mentor. In this role, you will have the option to either act as a host or serve as one of our Training Assistant Mentors â€” the choice is entirely up to you. A weekly roster will be created to ensure coverage and organization, and if you are unable to attend your scheduled time, it is your responsibility to contact the Head of Trainings as soon as possible to make alternate arrangements. This system helps maintain a smooth training process and ensures that all trainees receive the support they need.</p>
