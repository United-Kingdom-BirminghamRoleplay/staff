            <h1>Staff Vehicle Guide</h1>
            <p>When you are driving in a staff car within Birmingham Roleplay, you are representing our team, our community and our standards. It is vital that you maintain your standards even when you are on staff. We understand that on your vehicle it states ‘Not in roleplay’ however we strongly believe that staff should still follow high expectations by following the law and regulations.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-car"></i>STAFF LAW EXPECTATIONS</h2>
            <div class="punishment-level">
                <p>As a staff member, you are required to abide by the driving laws. This means using your signals when going left or right. Following the speed limit, following traffic signals, pulling over when an emergency vehicle is near. This is super vital to ensure you are blending in with roleplay and not ruining because you have staff authority and ‘Not in roleplay’ stated on the vehicle.</p>

            <div class="punishment-level">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stage 0:</strong> When you are not currently moderating and on break, you are required to park up in a safe parking bay out of roleplay paths and have no stages on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> These are standstill lights that sit still at all times. These alert players you are actively moderating, this does not allow you to go past traffic laws.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> These are lights that flash in a pattern. You only are required to use these lights when blocking off a situation that is escalating or in a particular event/scene that requires staff assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> These are standard emergency lights used also for police vehicles, you use these to pull over/pursue players. However we prefer you use our Melonly systems/ANPR to track players down instead of chasing them.</li>
